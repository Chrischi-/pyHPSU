# Control Scripts
Scripts to automatically control HPSU.
## Chrono-thermostat

Set of useful scripts to automatically control:
* heating timeframe
* cooling timeframe
* heating setpoints
* cooling setpoints

## Flow Temperature Control

Scripts to control heating flow temperature:
* PI Controller (inside temperature vs setpoint)
* heating power control within HPSU specifications

## To-do list
* Make all configuration parameters external
* Include DHW control inside chrono-thermostat (currently in crontab)
* Create cooling flow temperature control (nice to have)
